    <h1>Explanation</h1>
    <p>Mandatory to have one index.html file in root of main. But we can have multiple projects in one repository, they
        can be viewed as published versions using their own paths in url. Just need to use subfolders with index.html inside them
        and in Github Pages set branch from /root to /docs if you want to view the subfolder's index.html</p>
